  - "Grace - \"I\u2019m not exactly certain how long that woman survived for."
  - She was fed and drugged plenty throughout her time there.
  - The children suffered, the husband suffered, but she truly suffered.
  - 'Seeing their body parts all around her. I think it was months before I just left
    her entirely. '
  - I never went back down there.
  - I had moved on from her and began to experiment in other rooms around the house.
  - 'The officers did return though eventually. They demanded more payment as, apparently,
    she was some high up MP official whose disappearance had gained a lot of attention. '
  - 'Thankfully my boys were part of the investigation, but they needed extra payment
    for the extra cover up work. '
  - "As if saving their own necks wasn\u2019t payment enough."
  - I payed them, sure, but once the investigation was over, I decided to be rid of
    those two. One night I visited their homes and slit their throats.
  - I have lived rather quietly since, I put it all down to the excitement of being
    young and rebellious.
  - That, and I had the money to do that sort of thing."
