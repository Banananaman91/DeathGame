    like clockwork. I wasn\u2019t sure what to do."
  - One morning I received a knock at the door. After checking to see who it was,
    I opened it up to two police officers.
  - "\u2018I\u2019m sorry to disturb you ma\u2019am, but we have received reports
    of some screaming coming from this property through the night. The neighbours
    were concerned, and we were wondering if we could look around.\u2019"
  - I invited the officers to look. I was too frightened to tell the officers that
    I had heard the screaming too.
  - 'After so much sleep deprivation and still traumatized from what that woman did
    to me, I was scared to look crazy. '
  - They searched my home, but nothing was found.
  - I felt relieved to know that.
  - "\u2018Sorry to have bothered you ma\u2019am\u2019 \u2013 the officer said. \u2018Say,
    are you the same lady who we spoke to a week ago? The one who had just moved in?\u2019"
  - 'As if waiting for that moment the screaming started again. '
  - Much louder, constant, horrifying screams.
  - The officers panicked and began to follow it.
  - 'A secret room was found behind one of the book shelves. I had no idea it was
    there, but I recognised it straight away. '
  - The room I had been kept in.
  - The room that now contained the woman strapped to the chair.
  - 'I was arrested immediately. '
  - It was a long ordeal to convince the officers of my innocence, by which time the
    woman was long gone.
  - Sometimes I still have nightmares about her."
