  - Grace - "Midway through the night I slipped out of my bed.
  - I quietly made my way downstairs and checked in on the woman.
  - She was fast asleep.
  - I began to check through her things and found, in her purse, just what I had suspected.
  - There was a marking on the inside of her purse that shows she was with the resistance.
  - I knew I had to do something about her.
  - "I couldn\u2019t allow her to go free. I headed to the basement and found the
    chains I always kept for such an occasion."
  - My father was part of the military police and always said to keep this stuff just
    in case.
  - '. I decided that rushing her would be best. Her delirious state would help me
    be able to pin her down and chain her up. Once this was complete, I used some
    rope to string her up in a secret room behind a book case. '
  - 'This is where I proceeded to beat her as my own personal justice for her crimes
    against the state. '
  - There would be no need to rush and call the police just yet for this traitor,
    I can have some fun."
